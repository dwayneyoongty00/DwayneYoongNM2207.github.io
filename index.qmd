## About Me

I'm currently a **2nd year Psychology major**. My journey in the realm of psychology has led me to the fascinating world of **R programming**.

## My Interests

One of the subjects I'm taking this year is `NM2207`, which focuses on understanding the nuances of R programming. I have a deep-seated interest in **statistics**, and I believe that mastering R programming is pivotal in the psychological research field. Currently, I have a multitude of Statistics module such as PL2132, GEA1000, GEI1001, IT1244, and I'm hopping NM2207 would guide me towards a path into R statistics in Psychology

I believe that with these skills, I can contribute significantly to the field and expand my knowledge in areas that intersect psychology and data analysis.
