My journey in the realm of psychology has led me to the fascinating world of R programming.\n\n\n\nOne of the subjects I’m taking this year is NM2207, which focuses on understanding the nuances of R programming. I have a deep-seated interest in statistics, and I believe that mastering R programming is pivotal in the psychological research field. Currently, I have a multitude of Statistics module such as PL2132, GEA1000, GEI1001, IT1244, and I’m hopping NM2207 would guide me towards a path into R statistics in Psychology\n\n\n\nI am eager to learn how to read and evaluate datasets effectively. My goal is to extract meaningful trends and insights, which are crucial for psychological research. I believe that with these skills, I can contribute significantly to the field and expand my knowledge in areas that intersect psychology and data analysis."
